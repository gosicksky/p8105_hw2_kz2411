## Problem 1

``` r
# read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel
wheel_data <- read_excel('./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx',
                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N535") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls,digits = 0)
  )
```

``` r
# read and clean precipitation data for 2018
precipitation_2018_data <- read_excel('./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx',
                                      sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2018
  )
```

``` r
# read and clean precipitation data for 2019
precipitation_2019_data <- read_excel('./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx',
                                      sheet = "2019 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2019
  )
```

``` r
# combine dataset and convert month
precipitation_combine_data <- bind_rows(precipitation_2018_data, precipitation_2019_data) %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month]
  )
```

In Mr. Trash wheel dataset, there are 454 observations and 14 variables,
such as “weight\_tons” and “plastic bottles” which are numeric and
numeric respectively.

In the combination dataset, there are there are 24 observations and 3
variables, which are year, month and total. And their types are numeric,
character and numeric.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33.

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is 9
